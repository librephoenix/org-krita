#+TITLE: org-krita

Fork of [[https://github.com/lepisma/org-krita][org-krita]] originally by [[https://github.com/lepisma][lepisma]].

Tweaks included:
- Images are now extracted using the =org-krita-extract-filename= variable
  - Defaults to "mergedimage.png" (high fidelity)
  - Can be changed to "preview.png" (better performance)
- All images are scaled according to the variable =org-krita-scale= (defaults to 1)
- Editing now opens in krita's full mode by default

Minor mode for working with [[https://krita.org/en/][krita]] notes, sketches etc. in org mode.

** Quickstart
The package is not on melpa yet. For installing, you can clone the repo and load manually. Or if you are using [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]], you can
do the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-krita
    :ensure t
    :quelpa (org-krita :fetcher github :repo "librephoenix/org-krita" :files ("*.el" "resources"))
    :config
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-krita-mode))
#+end_src

Or, if you are using Doom emacs you can add this to your =packages.el=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-krita
  :recipe (:host github
           :repo "librephoenix/org-krita"
           :files ("resources" "resources" "*.el" "*.el")))
#+end_src

and this to your =config.el=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-krita
  :config
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-krita-mode))
#+end_src

=org-krita= creates a new org link type called =krita= that:
- when clicked on, opens krita for editing the file linked, and
- shows the updated image preview inline if =org-krita-mode= is enabled.

For using, you need to enable the minor mode =org-krita-mode= in org buffer with
=krita= links like this =[[krita:./some-file.kra][image]]=. To create new files
within the buffer itself, try calling =org-krita-insert-new-image=.
